GREENLAND:
Greenland is icy, mysterious, and one of the most naturally beautiful places 
on the planet. The world's biggest non-continental island is so much more than 
glaciers, too (although the glaciers are spectacular)â€”think magnificent fjords, 
colorful villages, fields of sheep, and that ever-alluring midnight sun.
