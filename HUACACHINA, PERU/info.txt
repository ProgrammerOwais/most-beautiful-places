HUACACHINA, PERU:
Psy lovers and artists will fall in love with Huacachina, a stunning desert 
oasis that leaves you mesmerized with its raw beauty and fantastical legends. 
Think of yourself sitting on a huge sand dune enjoying breath-taking sunset 
views as the landscape reveals vivid colors of red and yellow all around you. 
Right in front of you lies a dreamy oasis which looks like a still from one of 
those Arabian Nights movies, dotted with palm trees, covered with rustic hotels 
that offer the very best of luxury. Huacachina might lose out to Machu Picchu and 
Nazca in terms of popularity, but it provides a picture-perfect setting for those 
searching for mystery, adventure or romance. Spend the evening 
serenading your sweetheart by the lake, but donâ€™t forget to keep an eye out for the 
mermaid that is said to live there.
