THE FAIRY POOLS, ISLE OF SKYE, SCOTLAND:
You might suddenly start believing in fairies the moment your eyes fall 
on the Fairy Pool, an ethereal oasis that bewitches visitors with its crystal 
clear water, picture-perfect scenery and magical atmosphere. The waters are freezing, 
but if you’re searching for wild swimming adventures, it truly doesn’t get better than 
this. And if you’re not as adventurous, a mere walk around the area, exploring aqua blue 
pools, each more appealing than the other, is sure to leave you in high spirits. The place 
also has its own infinity pool, bounded by a beautiful stone wall!.
