Santorini is a must-see island that has it all - from hypnotic sunset views of volcanoes rising 
out of blue seas, to larger-than-life island identities like Mama who make it a real Greek 
island experience.The "default" location for most visitors is Fira, the largest and by far the busiest 
town on the island.

Oia is best known for breathtaking sunsets; if truth be told, sunrise in Oia is also magical

On Santorini, dramatic sea views are never far away. Bright white, cube-shaped dwellings cascade down hillsides. 
Those iconic blue domes topping churches perfectly match the water rippling all around. 
And the famed sunsets brilliantly light up the caldera. Yes, the islandâ€™s scenery more than lived up to 
expectations.

Oia is arguably the most beautiful village in Santorini. Home to magical sunsets, 
chocolate-box architecture, and delightful art galleries, it is also its most 
frequented destination. Clinging to the rim of the caldera, on the northern tip of the island, 
this whitewashed marvel is worth visiting for the views alone.
