NIAGARA FALLS, USA/ CANADA :
the most amazing and famous waterfalls in the world, attracting honeymooners 
and families and film crews alike. In fact, for generations, the beauty and 
awe evoked by the waters rushing down in great quantities up to 57 metres before 
reaching Lake Ontario have been inspiring artists like Thomas Cole, and the adventure 
enthusiasts who go down on barrels and walk across on ropes.
